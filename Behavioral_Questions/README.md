## 1. Tell me a little about yourself.

Hi there! My name is Imran, and I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from BSMRSTU, Gopalganj.

During my studies, I developed a strong passion for problem-solving and algorithms. This led me to delve into competitive programming, where I tackled over 1800 problems on various online platforms and achieved the 'Expert' level on Codeforces. My competitive experience extends beyond online platforms; I actively participated in prestigious coding contests like ICPC (five times) and its regional qualifiers (twice), along with the NCPC regional and Code Samurai Hackathon regional contests. These experiences not only honed my coding skills but also instilled valuable teamwork and problem-solving abilities under pressure.

At BSMRSTU, I actively contributed to the programming community as an executive member of the programming club. This role allowed me to mentor and collaborate with fellow students, further strengthening my communication and leadership skills.

While my core strengths lie in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, I'm also proficient in several programming languages. I'm confident in C++, JavaScript, Java, and Python. Additionally, I've been expanding my knowledge into web development and have a solid foundation in ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. I've applied this knowledge by working on several ReactJS projects, which significantly improved my understanding and proficiency in these technologies.

I'm incredibly enthusiastic about Frontend development and eager to gain practical experience. This Frontend Internship opportunity particularly excites me, as it aligns perfectly with my current skillset and aspirations. I'm confident that my problem-solving abilities, technical skills, and eagerness to learn make me a valuable asset to your team.

## 34. Will you lie for the company under any circumstances?
I believe in the principle of honesty. So, my willingness to be a part of the lie would depend on the situation and the outcomes associated with it. If my lie will not jeopardize anyone and brings a positive result for the company and the employees, then I can be a part of it. However, I do not feel good about lying.

## 35. What do you think is better - being perfect and delivering late or being good and delivering on time?
It depend on situation. But I believe that it is always better to be good and deliver on time. Time is money to the organization. If we are good and on time, then there is always room for improvement and enhancements. But if we deliver it late, then no amount of perfection can make up for the time lost.
