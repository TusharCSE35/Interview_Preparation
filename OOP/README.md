## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and organize software. It helps manage complex applications with reusable components.

---

## Principles of OOP

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of a class and exposing only necessary information through methods.

### Abstraction
Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding complex realities and exposing only the essential parts to the user.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent).

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, especially useful when overriding methods.

## Examples of OOP in Languages
- **C++**: Classes and inheritance
- **Java**: Interface implementation
- **Python**: Multiple inheritance and dynamic typing

---

## Real-World OOP Use Cases
- **Banking System**: Account, Transaction, and Customer as objects.
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Products, Orders, and Users as different entities.

---

## Best Practices
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions.
- Ensure proper encapsulation to secure data.
- Avoid deep inheritance chains for simplicity.
