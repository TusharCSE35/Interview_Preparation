## 1.1 What is the need for OOPs?

There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are: 

- OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they donâ€™t know the actual implementation.
- With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.
- Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.
