- **Remote Access VPN:** Connects individual users to a private network.
- **Site-to-Site VPN:** Connects entire networks to each other.
- **Client-based VPN:** Requires software on the client device.
- **Clientless VPN:** Allows access via a web browser without additional software.

### <a id="7">7. What are nodes and links?</a>
In networking, a **node** is any device that can send, receive, or forward information, while a **link** refers to the communication path that connects two nodes.

### <a id="8">8. What is the network topology?</a>
Network topology refers to the arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network. It defines how devices are interconnected.

### <a id="9">9. Define different types of network topology.</a>
Common types of network topologies include:
- **Star Topology:** All nodes are connected to a central hub.
- **Bus Topology:** All devices share a single communication line.
- **Ring Topology:** Each node is connected to two other nodes, forming a circular pathway.
- **Mesh Topology:** Each node is interconnected with multiple paths.

### <a id="10">10. How are Network types classified?</a>
Network types can be classified based on their size (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN), topology (star, bus, ring), or their communication methods (broadcast, point-to-point).

### <a id="11">11. What are Private and Special IP addresses?</a>
Private IP addresses are used within private networks and are not routable on the public internet. Special IP addresses include loopback addresses and link-local addresses, which serve specific functions in network communications.

### <a id="12">12. What is the DNS?</a>
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

### <a id="13">13. What is the use of a router and how is it different from a gateway?</a>
A router connects different networks and directs data packets between them. A gateway, on the other hand, serves as a "gate" between two networks, allowing communication between different protocols.

### <a id="14">14. What is the SMTP protocol?</a>
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for sending emails across networks.

### <a id="15">15. Describe the OSI Reference Model.</a>
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communication protocols in seven layers, from physical transmission to application.

### <a id="16">16. Define the 7 different layers of the OSI Reference Model.</a>
1. **Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical connection between devices.
2. **Data Link Layer:** Provides node-to-node data transfer.
3. **Network Layer:** Manages data routing and forwarding.
4. **Transport Layer:** Ensures complete data transfer.
5. **Session Layer:** Manages sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Translates data formats.
7. **Application Layer:** Interfaces with the end-user application.

### <a id="17">17. Describe the TCP/IP Reference Model.</a>
The TCP/IP Reference Model is a set of protocols used for communication over the internet, consisting of four layers: Link, Internet, Transport, and Application.

### <a id="18">18. Define the 4 different layers of the TCP/IP Reference Model.</a>
1. **Link Layer:** Handles physical network hardware.
2. **Internet Layer:** Manages logical addressing and routing.
3. **Transport Layer:** Provides end-to-end communication.
4. **Application Layer:** Supports application-level protocols.

### <a id="19">19. Differentiate OSI Reference Model with TCP/IP Reference Model.</a>
The OSI Model has seven layers, while the TCP/IP Model has four layers. The OSI model is more theoretical, while the TCP/IP model is more practical and widely used in the internet framework.

### <a id="20">20. What are the HTTP and the HTTPS protocol?</a>
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for transmitting web pages. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data for secure communication over the internet.

### <a id="21">21. What is the FTP protocol?</a>
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP-based network.

### <a id="22">22. What is the TCP protocol?</a>
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission between devices on a network.

### <a id="23">23. What is the UDP protocol?</a>
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that allows for fast data transmission without guaranteeing delivery or order.

### <a id="24">24. Compare between TCP and UDP.</a>
- **TCP** is connection-oriented, reliable, and ensures ordered data delivery, while **UDP** is connectionless, faster, and does not guarantee delivery or order.

### <a id="25">25. What is the ICMP protocol?</a>
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for error messages and operational information exchange in network communications.

### <a id="26">26. What do you mean by the DHCP Protocol?</a>
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.

### <a id="27">27. What is the ARP protocol?</a>
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map IP addresses to MAC (Media Access Control) addresses in a local network.

### <a id="28">28. What is the MAC address and how is it related to NIC?</a>
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication on the physical network segment.

### <a id="29">29. Differentiate the MAC address with the IP address.</a>
- **MAC Address:** Hardware address, used in local networks for device identification.
- **IP Address:** Logical address, used for routing across networks.
